The part 2 program is called storeCSV.py and is written in Python 2.7.10. The average running time of storeCSV.py is around 20 minutes. The program involved entering the CSV tables into the database postgres. We added the tables directly from Professor Nitta's directory. First, do start_postgres then run the program. 

Part 3a of the program is the file called query3a.py and takes around 5 minutes to print out the percent of individuals that travel less than 5-100 miles. 

Part 3b is the file called query3b.py and takes around 13 minutes to print out the average fuel economy of all miles traveled for trips. This file creates new tables to query from. 

Part 3c needs the tables created from Part 3b file query3b.py because it refers to the same tables for the natural join. This part takes around 10 seconds to print out the values for the percent of transporttion of CO_2 emissions.
